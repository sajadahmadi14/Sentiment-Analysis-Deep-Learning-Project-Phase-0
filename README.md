Development of a data loader for MCTD dataset
MCTD dataset analysis
 In phase 0 of our multi-modal sentiment analysis deep learning project, we focused on developing a data loader that could handle the different types of input data required for our model. Our model takes in three types of input data: pictures, text, and voice recordings. Each type of data requires a different preprocessing approach, and thus, our data loader had to be designed accordingly.

To develop the data loader, we studied the structure and format of each type of input data and designed a custom solution that could efficiently load them into memory for use by our deep learning model. This also involved analyzing the samples to ensure they were labeled correctly and were of good quality, free from any bias.

Once the data loader was fully functional, we turned our attention to analyzing the dataset. This involved performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to gain insights into the characteristics of the data, such as their distribution, correlation, and quality. We also examined any missing or erroneous data points and developed strategies to address these issues.

Overall, phase 0 of our multi-modal sentiment analysis deep learning project was crucial in laying the foundation for subsequent phases by providing us with a reliable data loader and a deep understanding of the characteristics of the input data. These essential steps will enable us to train accurate and robust deep learning models for the task of sentiment analysis across different modalities.
